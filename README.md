# NightFury_Decrypto

### What is NightFury_Decrypto

A basic script to encrypt and decrypt your data. Where the main catch is to deliver the encrypted file to the receiver. It divides the encrypted file into multiple parts and then send it to the receiver. Even if a hacker manages to get his/her hands on the file, in order to decrypt it, other files will be required as it will make the file more secured from hackers.

> **Encryption**


1. You can enter the short messages and it will encrypt it and while giving the output it will ask either to print it or to store it in the file. Along with the file one secret.key will be exported in the output folder which will be you  encryption/decryption key

2. User can print the encryption/decryption key to view the secret code and use that key to encypt the file later on.

3. If user have a file to encrypt instead of a small message then this option will be the best one as it will cover the full file and store the encrypted file in the output folder.
